# RelightKernel
An new generation kernel
I created this repo to post in a near future
my OS kernel.
taking inspiration from the linux kernel and BSD, but fixing the main bugs and
making everything much easier to understand.
My objective is make an powerful kernel, but user-friendly
and focused on safety and simplicity.
